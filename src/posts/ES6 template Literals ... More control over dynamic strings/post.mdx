Before ES6 came out with template Strings in 2015. The strings in JS have very limited in its syntax but also very limited in its functionality.

To enable you to solve more complex problems and concatenate strings together in a smooth way. Not just String to Strings but String with data values.ES6 template literals provide the syntax that allows you to work with Strings in a safer and cleaner way.
Gone will be the hours of long suffer with long string concatenation!

### Basic usage
The syntax of template strings is very simple, just use backticks instead of single or double quotes.
```javascript
let msg = `A string`;
```
If we want to surround a special world with a single or double quotes we can do that simply .. because we have used a different character to define our string.

### Multiline strings
Template strings make multiline much simpler. we can simply add a line break where we want to, press enter and there it is.
```javascript
let msg = `Hi,

Good job.

Regards`;
```
so we can format our string to look like as we wish. 

### Expressions
Template literals provide an easy way to contain placeholders and expressions into strings.You do so by using the ${...}
```javascript
const name = 'Naya';
const msg = `Hi ${name}`;
```
Inside of the curly braces, it's often gonna be a variable, but it could be a whole JavaScript expression or mathematical expression. Can be a function call, it can even be a template literal inside of that expression if you need it to be.
* **Mathematical expression**
```javascript
const msg = `You have ${1+3} Dogs`;
```
* **function call**
```javascript
const msg = `Hi ${nameFn()}`;
console.log(msg);
function nameFn() {
  return "Naya";
}
```
